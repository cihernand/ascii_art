## Queer Cyberactivism with ASCII ArtE

The cyberspace has opened a novel platform of communication and expression. In the case of the LGBTQ+ community, its existence has represented a place to be open and  make our identities visible. Whether this space is safe, accessible  and enables freedom  or not? It varies depending on who the user is. Currently, we live in a world where only some sectors of the population access certain privileges and they are blind to the problems experienced by others. For example, the struggles faced by individuals who are censored, criminalized or discriminated for who they are or their ideas; they still do not live with freedom. How can we awake as a community to develop solidarity for other groups fighting to be visible, recognized, respected,  and to prevent that their human rights continue to be denied. During the workshop, ASCII ArtE, we will challenge our senses to recognize in other persons both LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ certain aspects of life that are normally taken for granted, but unfortunately they are the exemption for many people living in realities under social and political conflicts, people belonging to different religions, social classes and nationalities, and people experiencing different health conditions. How can we stop a political culture and discourse for granting privileges and move towards building inclusive and universal changes?   

The journey of this workshop has been drawn by experiences both mine and from close friends. It is a bit messy and chaotic, unexpected, challenging, difficult,  full of emotions and self reflection; similar to the way that existence and life just happen.

### What is ASCII ArtE?

Text, letters, numbers, symbols and special characters are one of the many tools to express and communicate our ideas, feelings and personal narratives. The use of characters is as much a part of the cyberspace as emoticons, memes, gifs, or LOL. ASCII art is made of characters and it includes pictures and text like the following.:

``` bash
            ^^                ___     _   _ U _____ uU _____ u   ____     
                             / " \ U |"|u| |\| ___"|/\| ___"|/U |  _"\ u  
     ¬¬'                    | |"| | \| |\| | |  _|"   |  _|"   \| |_) |/          %%..%%
             °|°)          /| |_| |\ | |_| | | |___   | |___    |  _ <       °/°    ==
                           U \__\_\u<<\___/  |_____|  |_____|   |_| \_\                               
              000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000             
                              (_(__)    (__) (__) (__)(__) (__) (__)  (__)
```

### What do you experience as the cyberspace, who exists there, who it belongs to?

The limits of our creativity are constantly challenged by the invention of new worlds, new forms of expression, new technologies, new spaces and new realities. The fact that we are more (dis-)connected but through virtual networks dominated by ... humans (which humans)? bots? algorithms?, represents an invitation to reflect on how we use this space and question its role in shaping  us and our current society.

 "Is the Net a space of domination, domestication, hegemony and homogeneity? Or is it a space in dispute, in struggle? Can we speak of a digital materialism? You who create art there, do you see the storm? Do you suffer from it? Do you resist? Do you rebel?"

These questions come from  [Zapatistas](http://enlacezapatista.ezln.org.mx/2017/07/15/art-resistance-and-rebellion-on-the-net/) and the project [compArte](http://comparte.digital) digital, an invitation for rebellion and resistance to defend the cyberspace.

```

### Art, an universal language to portrait our human experiences


``` bash
    / \ / \ / \   / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \   / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \   / \ / \ / \ / \   / \  / \
  °| ( T | h | e ) * (w | o | r | k | s | h | o | p ) * ( s | t | a | r | t | s ) * ( h | e | r | e )  |°  
    \_/   \_/ \_/ \_/   \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/   \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/   \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/  \_/  
```

°/° We will create something to bring us to existence, we will create something to be visible (^^), we will see us through others and we will connect our experiences with testimonies of people who we have never meet [==] or who have been always there but we have decided to never see /¬¬'/.

###  I. From the cyberspace to the streets


#### The Role of Graffiti and Street Art in the public life, images in the Egyptian revolution.
By Chad Elias

"The extraordinary proliferation of street art and  Graffiti
in Egyptian towns and cities has made new forms of democratic
participation in public space possible. (...) Graffiti invites
citizens to actively participate in public debate about how to live
together and declare their rights under authoritarian power
structures."


#### Fragments from The Sad Transition
By Sad Panda

"Humanity can be described  using a multitude of adjectives depending
upon the realities surrounding a person. One's upbringing or current
environment, political or economical surroundings, or social
life defined by the family and friends help define their existence.
People distinguish themselves from one another through their education,
jobs, or financial status. Each person has a unique talent that sets
them apart from others - some draw, others write; some plant,others beg.
But while everyone has experienced moments full of happiness, hard work,or
accomplishment, there is only one feeling that is universal - sadness."


"The thing that has made me most sad in my experience with people
is their ability to trivialize the greatest things. This is the
blindness that I mention above. People trivialize great things: the
ability for a human being to wake up every morning and not die,
or the ability to eat and then excrete food from the body.We do
these things every day and every hour without any thought. There are
countless important processes that a human being perceives as normal
and natural and doesn't consciously think about. In contrast, people
prioritize money, cars, football, and large-chested women. It is normal for
a person this blind to claim he is happy after buying a huge car in a country
with no proper road infrastructure, or when marrying a beautiful, doll-like
woman with multiple plastic surgeries."

"We must destroy these corrupt theories of happiness. We must cure people
of their blindness, each in their own way. While some people write and
others paint. I myself vandalize their property to spread sadness everywhere,
in the hope that they feel all the sadness of this morbid world."

Cairo.


#### Queer Identity and Street Art Activism
By Bansky

[Queen Vic](http://www.smartmodernart.com/image-files/queenvicred32x20in.jpg)
"(Queen Victoria) is a 2003 work and one of the
first images printed at prictures On Walls, the artist's print
house, which opened its doors in 2003 at 46 Commercial Rd., London.
Bansky is famous for satirizing power: the image depics Queen
Victoria as a lesbian engaged in "queening". Queen Victoria
once declared that woman aren't able to be gay and approved laws
against homosexuality. The stencil is located on the rulling
shutter of a store between St. Mark's Road and Brenner Street in
Bristol in 2002. The image was displayed on a cavanas for the first
time in 2003 in a collective exhibition at the Vanina Holasek Gallery
in New York."

"It is a powerful portrayal of the first three years of the Egyptian revolution that began on January 25, 2011.The story is told through striking images of art that transformed Egypt’s walls into a visual testimony of bravery and resistance. Created in close collaboration with artists on the frontlines of the battle, the book documents how they converted the streets into a dynamic newspaper of the people, providing a much needed alternative to the propaganda-fueled media. This comprehensive survey of iconic street art of the Egyptian revolution includes a chronicle of the day-to-day volatile political situation as it rapidly unfolded. ‘Walls of Freedom’ traces the revolutionary journey, from the early pinnacle of extraordinary hope and inspiration, to its decline into today’s violent Orwellian nightmare. Haunting images of key events captured by acclaimed photographers and activists set the stage for this political drama. Enriched with essays by artists and experts across many fields, Walls of Freedom contextualizes the graffiti in the historical, socio-political, and cultural backgrounds that have shaped this art of the revolution.Curated & edited by Basma Hamdy, Don Karl Foreword by Ahdaf Soueif Booker prize finalist, novelist, political & cultural commentator."
