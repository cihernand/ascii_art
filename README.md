### Cyberactivism with ASCII-ArtE

Dear artists, creators and enthusiatics from the World:

The limits of our creativity are constantly challenged by the innvention of new worlds, new spaces and new realities. The fact that we are more connected but through virtual networks dominated by bots and algorithms, represents an invitation for rebellion and resistance to defend the cyberspace.

Below I share you some questions from [Zapatistas](http://enlacezapatista.ezln.org.mx/2017/07/15/art-resistance-and-rebellion-on-the-net/) and the [compArte](http://comparte.digital) digital :

"Is the Net a space of domination, domestication, hegemony and homogeneity? Or is it a space in dispute, in struggle? Can we speak of a digital materialism? You who create art there, do you see the storm? Do you suffer from it? Do you resist? Do you rebel?"
