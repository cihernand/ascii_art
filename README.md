### Cyberactivism with ASCII-ArtE

Dear artists, creators and enthusiastics from the World,

The limits of our creativity are constantly challenged by the innvention of new worlds, new spaces and new realities. The fact that we are more connected but through virtual networks dominated by bots and algorithms, represents an invitation for rebellion and resistance to defend the cyberspace.

Below I share you some questions from [Zapatistas](http://enlacezapatista.ezln.org.mx/2017/07/15/art-resistance-and-rebellion-on-the-net/) and the project [compArte](http://comparte.digital) digital :

"Is the Net a space of domination, domestication, hegemony and homogeneity? Or is it a space in dispute, in struggle? Can we speak of a digital materialism? You who create art there, do you see the storm? Do you suffer from it? Do you resist? Do you rebel?" 

### How do Street Art and ASCII ArtE intersect?

#### The Role of Graffiti and Street Art in the public life, images in the egyptian revolution.

By Chad Elias

"The extraordinary proliferation of street art and  Graffiti
in Egyptian towns and cities has made new forms of democratic 
participation in public space possible. (...) Graffiti invites
citizens to actively participate in public debate about how to live 
together and declare their rights under authoritarian power 
structures."


#### Fragments from The Sad Transition
By Sad Panda

"Humanity can be described  using a multitude of adjectives depending 
upon the realities surrounding a person. One's upbringing or current
environment, political or economical surroundings, or social
life defined by the family and friends help define their existence.
People distinguish themselves from one another through their education,
jobs, or financial status. Each person has a unique talent that sets
them apart from others - some draw, others write; some plant,others beg.
But while everyone has experienced moments full of happiness, hard work,or
accomplishment, there is only one feeling that is universal - sadness."


"The thing that has made me most sad in my experience with people
is their ability to trivialize the greatest things. This is the
blindness that I mention above. People trivialize great things: the
ability for a human being to wake up every morning and not die,
or the ability to eat and then excrete food from the body.We do
these things every day and every hour without any thought. There are
countless important processes that a human being perceives as normal
and natural and doesn't consciously think about. In contrast, people
prioritize money, cars, football, and large-chested women. It is normal for 
a person this blind to claim he is happy after buying a huge car in a country 
with no proper road infrastructure, or when marrying a beautiful, doll-like
woman with multiple plastic surgeries."

"We must destroy these corrupt theories of happiness. We must cure people
of their blindness, each in their own way. While some people write and 
others paint. I myself vandalize their property to spread sadness everywhere,
in the hope that they feel all the sadness of this morbid world."

Cairo.


### Art makes intersect universal human identities and experiences

#### Queer Identity and Street Art Activism 
By Bansky

"[Queen Vic](http://i.ebayimg.com/16/!BdhfGgg!2k~$(KGrHqEOKjUEq3-GyigbBK5QKmv8P!~~_3.JPG) (Queen Victoria) is a 2003 work and one of the
first images printed at prictures On Walls, the artist's print 
house, which opened its doors in 2003 at 46 Commercial Rd., London.
Bansky is famous for satirizing power: the image depics Queen
Victoria as a lesbian engaged in "queening". Queen Victoria
once declared that woman aren't able to be gay and approved laws
against homosexuality. The stencil is located on the rulling 
shutter of a store between St. Mark's Road and Brenner Street in 
Bristol in 2002. The image was displayed on a cavanas for the first
time in 2003 in a collective exhibition at the Vanina Holasek Gallery 
in New York."
